The Future of Artificial Intelligence

The future of AI holds tremendous potential and challenges. Researchers are working on 
achieving Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) - AI systems with human-level intelligence 
across all domains. While this remains a long-term goal, incremental advances continue to 
expand AI capabilities.

Emerging trends include edge AI (running AI on local devices), explainable AI (making AI 
decisions more transparent), and AI democratization (making AI tools accessible to non-experts). 
The integration of AI with other technologies like quantum computing and biotechnology may 
lead to breakthroughs we can't yet imagine.
