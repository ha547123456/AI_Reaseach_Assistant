Supervised Learning Methods

Supervised learning is a machine learning paradigm where the algorithm learns from labeled 
training data. The algorithm receives input-output pairs and learns to map inputs to correct 
outputs. Common algorithms include linear regression, logistic regression, decision trees, 
random forests, and support vector machines.

Applications include spam detection, image classification, price prediction, and medical 
diagnosis. The quality of supervised learning models heavily depends on having sufficient 
high-quality labeled training data.
