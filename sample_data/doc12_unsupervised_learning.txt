Unsupervised Learning Techniques

Unsupervised learning works with unlabeled data to discover hidden patterns or structures. 
Unlike supervised learning, there are no predefined correct answers. Common techniques include 
clustering (grouping similar items), dimensionality reduction, and anomaly detection.

Applications include customer segmentation, recommendation systems, and data compression. 
Unsupervised learning is particularly valuable when labeled data is expensive or impossible 
to obtain.
