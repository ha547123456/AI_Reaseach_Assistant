Key AI Algorithms

Various algorithms power different AI applications. Classification algorithms categorize data 
into predefined classes. Regression algorithms predict continuous values. Clustering algorithms 
group similar data points. Decision trees make decisions through tree-like models.

Ensemble methods combine multiple algorithms for better performance. Gradient boosting, random 
forests, and neural networks are popular choices. The selection of algorithm depends on the 
problem type, data characteristics, and performance requirements.
