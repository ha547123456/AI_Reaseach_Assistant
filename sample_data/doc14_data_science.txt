Data Science and AI

Data science is the foundation of modern AI systems. It involves extracting insights from 
structured and unstructured data using scientific methods, algorithms, and systems. Data 
scientists prepare and analyze data to train AI models and evaluate their performance.

The data science pipeline includes data collection, cleaning, exploration, feature engineering, 
model training, evaluation, and deployment. Good data science practices are essential for 
building reliable and effective AI systems.
