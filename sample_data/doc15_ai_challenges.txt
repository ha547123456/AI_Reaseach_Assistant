Current Challenges in AI

Despite remarkable progress, AI faces several challenges. Data quality and availability remain 
significant issues. Many AI systems require massive amounts of labeled data, which is expensive 
to create. AI models can be opaque, making it difficult to understand their decision-making 
process.

Other challenges include adversarial attacks, bias and fairness concerns, energy consumption 
of large models, and the need for specialized hardware. Addressing these challenges is crucial 
for advancing AI technology responsibly and sustainably.
