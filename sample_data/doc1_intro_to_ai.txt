Artificial Intelligence: An Introduction

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, 
especially computer systems. These processes include learning, reasoning, and self-correction. 
AI has become increasingly important in modern technology and is used in various applications 
from virtual assistants to autonomous vehicles.

The field of AI research was founded on the claim that human intelligence can be so precisely 
described that a machine can be made to simulate it. This raises philosophical arguments about 
the mind and the ethics of creating artificial beings with human-like intelligence.
