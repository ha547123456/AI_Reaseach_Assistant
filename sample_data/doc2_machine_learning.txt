Machine Learning Fundamentals

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on developing systems 
that can learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. It uses 
algorithms to parse data, learn from it, and make determinations or predictions.

There are three main types of machine learning: supervised learning, unsupervised learning, 
and reinforcement learning. Each has its own use cases and benefits depending on the problem 
being solved.
