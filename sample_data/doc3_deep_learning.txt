Deep Learning and Neural Networks

Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses neural networks with multiple layers. 
These deep neural networks are capable of learning complex patterns in large amounts of data. 
The "deep" in deep learning refers to the number of layers in the neural network.

Applications of deep learning include image recognition, natural language processing, speech 
recognition, and many other domains. Deep learning has achieved remarkable success in tasks 
that were previously considered extremely difficult for computers.
