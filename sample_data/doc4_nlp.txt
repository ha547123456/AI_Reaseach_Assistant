Natural Language Processing

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a branch of artificial intelligence that helps computers 
understand, interpret, and manipulate human language. NLP draws from many disciplines, including 
computer science and computational linguistics, to bridge the gap between human communication 
and computer understanding.

Modern NLP applications include machine translation, sentiment analysis, chatbots, and text 
summarization. Recent advances in deep learning have significantly improved the capabilities 
of NLP systems.
