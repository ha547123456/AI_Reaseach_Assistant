Computer Vision Technology

Computer vision is a field of artificial intelligence that trains computers to interpret and 
understand the visual world. Using digital images from cameras and videos and deep learning 
models, machines can accurately identify and classify objects.

Applications include facial recognition, autonomous vehicles, medical image analysis, and 
augmented reality. Computer vision is one of the most rapidly advancing areas of AI research.
