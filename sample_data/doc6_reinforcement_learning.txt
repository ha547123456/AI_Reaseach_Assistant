Reinforcement Learning Principles

Reinforcement learning is a type of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions 
by performing actions in an environment to maximize some notion of cumulative reward. Unlike 
supervised learning, the agent is not told which actions to take but must discover which 
actions yield the most reward through trial and error.

Famous applications include game playing (like AlphaGo), robotics, and autonomous systems. 
Reinforcement learning is particularly useful when the optimal solution is not known in advance.
