Ethics in Artificial Intelligence

As AI systems become more prevalent, ethical considerations become increasingly important. 
Issues include bias in AI algorithms, privacy concerns, job displacement, and the potential 
for misuse of AI technology. Ensuring AI systems are fair, transparent, and accountable is 
crucial for their responsible development and deployment.

Organizations and researchers are working on frameworks for ethical AI development, including 
principles of transparency, fairness, privacy protection, and human oversight. The goal is to 
create AI systems that benefit society while minimizing potential harms.
