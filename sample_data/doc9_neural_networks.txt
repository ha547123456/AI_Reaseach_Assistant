Understanding Neural Networks

Neural networks are computing systems inspired by biological neural networks in animal brains. 
They consist of interconnected nodes (neurons) organized in layers. Information flows through 
the network, with each neuron processing inputs and passing outputs to the next layer.

Different architectures exist for different tasks: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for 
image processing, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for sequential data, and Transformers for 
natural language understanding. Training neural networks involves adjusting connection weights 
to minimize error on training data.
